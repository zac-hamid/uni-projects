# Security Engineering Major Project
For the security engineering major project, we were allowed to choose any topic related to security that we wanted, either technical or non-technical.
My project is, in essence, a simplified implementation of a lot of the features present in modern cryptocurrencies.

Features include:
* SHA256 hasher
* Public-Private asymmetric keypair generation using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (with ECDSA for signing transactions)
* Mining blocks on the blockchain (by solving the hash function with a specified difficulty)
* Making transactions on the blockchain
* Wallets
