<h1>Security Engineering Major Project</h1>
For the security engineering major project, we were allowed to choose any topic related to security that we wanted, either technical or non-technical.

My project is, in essence, a simplified implementation of a lot of the features present in modern cryptocurrencies.

Features include:
<ul>
	<li> SHA256 hashing algorithm (made by me) </li>
	<li> Public-Private asymmetric keypair generation using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (with ECDSA for signing transactions)</li>
	<li> Mining blocks on the blockchain (by solving the hash function with a specified difficulty) <li>
	<li> Making transactions on the blockchain </li>
	<li> Wallets </li>
</ul>
